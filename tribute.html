     Dragon Ball is one of his mangas and animes series.
    First serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1984, it follows the adventures of Son Goku 
    from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts and explores the world
     in search of the Dragon Balls—seven magical orbs that summon a dragon capable of granting wishes.
    Son Goku embodies valuable life lessons such as perseverance in the face of challenges,
     viewing adversity as a chance for growth, and the importance of strong friendships.
      His humility and openness to learning from others highlight the significance of personal
       development, while his diverse relationships demonstrate the beauty of acceptance and teamwork. 
       Additionally, Goku teaches us to find joy in the journey rather than solely focusing on end goals,
        making him a role model for resilience, camaraderie, and continuous self-improvement.
